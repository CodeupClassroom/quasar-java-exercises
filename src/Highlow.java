    //    5. Game Development 101

//    Welcome to the world of game development!
//
//    You are going to build a high-low guessing game. Create a class named HighLow inside of src.
//
//    The specs for the game are:
//
//    - Game picks a random number between 1 and 100.
//    - Prompts user to guess the number.
//    - All user inputs are validated.
//    - If user's guess is less than the number, it outputs "HIGHER".
//    - If user's guess is more than the number, it outputs "LOWER".
//    - If a user guesses the number, the game should declare "GOOD GUESS!"
